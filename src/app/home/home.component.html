	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
		GECJ boasts a vibrant sports culture that keeps students active and energized throughout the year. Our calendar is filled with exciting events, from intra-college championships to major college tournaments, fostering healthy competition and camaraderie. To nurture this spirit and provide students with the right platform to pursue their athletic passions, GECJ offers world-class facilities — including basketball and volleyball courts, a cricket ground, kho-kho and kabaddi arenas, badminton and table tennis setups, and dedicated spaces for indoor games like chess and carrom — catering to a wide range of sporting interests. This commitment goes beyond infrastructure, as both students and faculty actively contribute to honing skills, building discipline, and fostering strong bonds through true sportsmanship.
